To deactivate a Python virtual environment created with `python -m venv`, you can follow these steps:

### Deactivation Steps

1. **Open Your Terminal**: Ensure you have your terminal or command prompt open where your virtual environment is currently active.

2. **Use the Deactivate Command**: Simply type the following command and press Enter:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

This command works across all operating systems (Windows, macOS, and Linux) and will return you to the systemâ€™s default Python environment.

### Additional Information

- **No Need to Navigate**: You do not need to navigate to any specific directory to run the `deactivate` command; it can be executed from anywhere as long as the virtual environment is active.

- **Closing the Terminal**: Alternatively, you can also close the terminal window or tab where the virtual environment was activated, which will automatically deactivate it.

- **Reactivating the Environment**: If you wish to reactivate the virtual environment later, use:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
   .\venv\Scripts\activate    # For Windows
   ```

By following these steps, you can easily deactivate your Python virtual environment and return to your system's default Python settings.
