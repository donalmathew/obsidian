I am participating in a hackathon conducted by **Accenture**, and the result of this hackathon will decide if I get a job there or not.

**Theme:** "Leverage Generative AI to create innovative business models that disrupt traditional industries or align with environmental and social governance (ESG) objectives, fostering sustainable growth for businesses and society alike."

**My Idea:**  
Many **content creators on social media platforms** (like YouTube, Instagram, or TikTok) face **creative blocks** where they struggle to come up with new ideas. My idea is to develop an **AI-powered content suggestion platform** that analyzes **current news** and **trends relevant to their field** and suggests fresh content ideas to creators.

**How It Works:**

- **User Input:** The creator selects their **area of interest** or **niche** (e.g., tech reviews, fitness, or lifestyle).
- **AI Output:** The AI model provides **content ideas** based on real-time **trends, news, or events** that align with their niche.
- **Use Cases:** It will help **influencers**, **businesses**, and **brands** generate relevant content and engage their audiences during **creative blocks**.

**What I Need:**  
Please provide a **step-by-step guide** for building this project, including how to organize the **files and folders**. You can suggest any **resources, libraries, or frameworks** necessary for the development process.

I am going to participate in a hackathon conducted by a company named accenture. The result of this hackthon will decide if i get a job there or not.
The theme of the hackathon is: "Leverage Generative AI to create innovative business models that disrupt traditional industries or align with environmental and social governance objectives, fostering sustainable growth for businesses and society alike." and encourages students to think creatively about how artificial intelligence can be used to transform existing industries or help businesses meet sustainability goals.

my idea is this:
"social media content creators often lack ideas for contents. What about an ai model which studies the current news in the world and trends relevant to the field in which they are in and suggests contents for them. They may not be in need of help for content normally, but in times in which they lack ideas, this ai model will come in handy.This can be used for content creators in youtube, instagram, any social media, or businessess that need customer interaction."

The platform(or what you call this ai thing), will accept the field in which i usually work, and will give me generated contents from which i can select(you can change this functionality to your liking).

So what i need will be step by step guide including creation and arrangement of files and folders to make this project come true. You can take any resourse you need.
