For your "Engineering Degree Seminar Report" based on the contents provided, you can divide the sections as follows:

### 1. Introduction
   - **Content:** 
     - Introduce the importance of database systems in modern applications.
     - Briefly outline the evolution from traditional SQL databases to NoSQL and the need for polyglot persistence.
     - Mention the increasing complexity of distributed database systems and the relevance of CAP theorem in maintaining consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.
   - **Length:** 1-2 pages.

### 2. Denormalization
   - **Content:**
     - Explain the concept of normalization in databases and the reasons for denormalization.
     - Discuss the trade-offs between normalization and denormalization, with examples of when and why denormalization is used.
     - Explore the impact of denormalization on database performance and integrity.
   - **Length:** 3-4 pages.

### 3. NoSQL and Polyglot Persistence
   - **3.1 NoSQL**
     - **3.1.1 SQL vs NoSQL**
       - Compare and contrast SQL and NoSQL databases in terms of data model, scalability, performance, and use cases.
     - **3.1.2 Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling**
       - Explain the concepts of vertical and horizontal scaling.
       - Discuss how NoSQL databases handle scaling compared to traditional SQL databases.
     - **3.1.3 Immediate Consistency vs Eventual Consistency**
       - Define and differentiate between immediate consistency and eventual consistency.
       - Discuss scenarios where each consistency model is preferred in NoSQL databases.
     - **Length:** 5-6 pages for the entire NoSQL section.
   - **3.2 Polyglot Persistence**
     - **Content:**
       - Introduce the concept of polyglot persistence and its benefits in modern applications.
       - Discuss the challenges of managing multiple database technologies within a single application.
       - Provide examples of systems that use polyglot persistence and how they manage data consistency across different databases.
     - **Length:** 3-4 pages.

### 4. Distributed Database Systems and CAP Theorem
   - **4.1 Distributed Database Systems**
     - **Content:**
       - Describe the architecture of distributed database systems.
       - Discuss the benefits and challenges of distributing databases across multiple locations.
       - Provide examples of distributed databases and their use cases.
     - **Length:** 3-4 pages.
   - **4.2 CAP Theorem**
     - **4.2.1 What is Network Partition**
       - Explain the CAP theorem in detail and its significance in distributed systems.
       - Discuss the three components of the CAP theorem: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.
       - Explore the practical implications of the CAP theorem in database design, with examples.
     - **Length:** 4-5 pages for the entire CAP Theorem section.

### 5. Conclusion
   - **Content:**
     - Summarize the key points discussed in the report.
     - Reflect on the future of database systems, particularly in the context of emerging technologies such as cloud computing and big data.
     - Mention the ongoing challenges in database design and the importance of continued research and development in this field.
   - **Length:** 1-2 pages.

### 6. References
   - **Content:** 
     - List the research papers youâ€™ve reviewed in IEEE/ACM/Springer/Elsevier format.
   - **Length:** 1 page (formatted references).

This structure should provide a comprehensive and balanced report, covering all major topics related to your seminar presentation.
