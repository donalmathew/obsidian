We are looking for a motivated and enthusiastic **Associate Fullstack Software Engineer** to join our growing team. This is an entry-level role, perfect for recent graduates or individuals with coding experience who are passionate about software development and eager to grow their skills. You will have the opportunity to work on both backend and frontend development, collaborating closely with experienced engineers to build high-quality web applications. While experience in **C#** and **ReactJS** is a plus, equivalent experience in other languages or frameworks is also welcome.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Write, test, and maintain both backend and frontend code to create responsive, reliable web applications.
- Work closely with senior developers to gain exposure to the full development lifecycleâ€”from gathering requirements to deployment.
- Assist in building **RESTful APIs** and backend services using **C#**, **.NET**, or equivalent backend technologies.
- Develop dynamic and responsive user interfaces using **ReactJS**, or other front-end frameworks such as **Angular** or **Vue.js**.
- Collaborate with cross-functional teams, including product managers, UX designers, and QA engineers, to deliver features that meet business needs.
- Learn and implement best coding practices such as version control, unit testing, and debugging.
- Participate in code reviews and continuous learning opportunities to improve technical skills.
- Support and contribute to agile development processes, including sprint planning and retrospectives.

**Requirements:**

- A degree in **Computer Science**, **Software Engineering**, or related field, or completion of a coding bootcamp/technical certification.
- Familiarity with one or more programming languages (e.g., **C#**, **Java**, **Python**, or **JavaScript**).
- Basic understanding of **frontend development** technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript).
- Exposure to frontend frameworks such as **ReactJS**, **Angular**, or **Vue.js** is a plus.
- Knowledge of backend development concepts and an interest in working with frameworks like **.NET**, **Node.js**, or similar.
- Familiarity with databases (e.g., **SQL**, **PostgreSQL**, or **NoSQL**) is an advantage.
- Enthusiasm for learning and a desire to develop both technical and problem-solving skills.
- Strong collaboration and communication skills, with a proactive approach to teamwork.

**Preferred Qualifications:**

- Hands-on experience in school projects, personal projects, or internships involving fullstack development.
- Basic understanding of version control tools (e.g., **Git**).
- Familiarity with RESTful APIs and basic software architecture principles.
