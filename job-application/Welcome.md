# Here’s a 30-day routine to help you systematically approach job applications and networking:  
  
Day 1-3: Preparation  
  
☑️ Organize your resume, cover letters, and LinkedIn profile.  
☑️ Identify your top 5-7 ideal job titles and companies. [take help if Gemini AI]  
  
Day 4-7: Job Search & Targeted Applications  
  
☑️ Apply to at least 5 relevant jobs daily on LinkedIn, Indeed, and niche job boards.  
☑️ Tailor your resume and cover letter to match each job description.  
  
Day 8-10: Network & Referrals  
  
☑️ Contact 5-7 connections per day. Start with former colleagues and LinkedIn connections.  
☑️ Use this script: “I’m currently exploring new opportunities in [industry]. I noticed you work at [company] and thought to reach out for insights or possible referrals.”  
  
Day 11-15: Social Proof & Visibility  
  
☑️ Post content on LinkedIn highlighting your expertise, career wins, and industry insights. You already have a strong Instagram following, so repurpose high-engagement content.  
  
☑️ Engage with posts from hiring managers and industry leaders. Leave thoughtful comments to boost your visibility.  
  
Day 16-20: 1:1 Calls & Informational Interviews  
  
☑️ Schedule 3-5 informational interviews with people working in your target roles. Be direct: “I’m keen on learning more about [company] and would love a quick 15-minute chat about your experience.”  
  
💎 Remember - you need to ask for an advice, NOT a favour. That’s the trick for you to get people on 1:1 calls.  
  
Day 21-25: Referral Follow-ups & Re-engagement  
  
☑️ Follow up with your network contacts and recruiters from previous applications. Keep it concise: “I wanted to check if there’s any update on my application for [role].”  
☑️ Join relevant LinkedIn groups, participate in discussions, and offer your insights.  
  
Day 26-30: Reflect & Optimize  
  
☑️ Review which approaches generated the most responses.  
☑️ Revisit companies and contacts who haven’t responded.  
☑️ Double down on high-response strategies, tweak what’s not working.  
  
Follow this 30 days plan.  
  
Check what’s working for you and what is not. Rinse and repeat.  
  
You’ll have to look to any other changes in plan once you follow it.
