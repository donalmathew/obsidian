## Text Formatting in Obsidian

Obsidian is a powerful markdown editor that allows users to format their notes using simple markdown syntax. Below is a comprehensive guide covering the essential formatting techniques available in Obsidian.

### **Basic Text Formatting**

1. **Bold Text**
   - To make text bold, wrap it in either double asterisks or double underscores:
     ```
     **This is bold text**
     __This is also bold text__
     ```

2. **Italic Text**
   - For italicized text, use single asterisks or underscores:
     ```
     *This is italic text*
     _This is also italic text_
     ```

3. **Strikethrough**
   - To create strikethrough text, use double tildes:
     ```
     ~~This text has a strikethrough~~
     ```

4. **Highlighted Text**
   - Highlight text using double equals signs:
     ```
     ==This text is highlighted==
     ```

### **Headings and Horizontal Rules**

Obsidian supports up to six levels of headings, which can be created using hash symbols:

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```

To insert a horizontal rule, type three hyphens, asterisks, or underscores on a new line:
```
---
```

### **Lists**

Creating lists in Obsidian can be done with simple symbols:

- **Unordered Lists**: Use dashes, asterisks, or plus signs.
  ```
  - Item 1
  - Item 2
  ```

- **Ordered Lists**: Use numbers followed by periods.
  ```
  1. First item
  2. Second item
  ```

### **Code Blocks**

Obsidian allows for both inline and block code formatting:

- **Inline Code**: Use single backticks.
  ```
  Here is some `inline code`.
  ```

- **Block Code**: Use triple backticks followed by the programming language for syntax highlighting.
  ```markdown
  ```python
  print("Hello, World!")
  ```
  
### **Tables**

Tables can be created using pipes and dashes. For easier management, consider using the "Advanced Tables" plugin:

```
| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Row 1  | Data       |
| Row 2  | More Data  |
```

### **Block Quotes and Callouts**

To create block quotes, use the greater-than symbol:
```
> This is a block quote.
```

For callouts (like notes or warnings), use the following syntax:
```
> [!note] This is a note.
```

### **Combining Formats**

You can combine different formats as needed. For example, to create bold italic text:
```
***Bold and italic text***
```
or 
```
__*Bold and italic text*__
```

### **Additional Tips**

- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: You can quickly apply formatting by selecting text and using keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+B for bold).
- **Escaping Characters**: If you want to display markdown symbols without formatting them, precede them with a backslash (e.g., `\*\*not bold\*\*`).

### **Conclusion**

Mastering these formatting techniques will enhance your note-taking experience in Obsidian, allowing for organized and visually appealing documents. The flexibility of markdown combined with Obsidian's features makes it an excellent choice for personal knowledge management.
