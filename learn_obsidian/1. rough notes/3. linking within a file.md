To link headings and subheadings in Obsidian, you can use a specific syntax that allows you to create internal links within your notes. Hereâ€™s how to do it effectively:

## Linking to Headings

1. **Basic Syntax**:
   - To link to a heading within the same note, type:
     ```
     [[#Heading]]
     ```
   - For example, if you have a heading titled "Overview," you would write:
     ```
     [[#Overview]]
     ```

2. **Linking to Headings in Other Notes**:
   - To link to a heading in a different note, use the following format:
     ```
     [[Note Title#Heading]]
     ```
   - For instance, if you want to link to the "Details" heading in a note titled "Project Plan," you would write:
     ```
     [[Project Plan#Details]]
     ```

3. **Custom Link Text**:
   - If you want the link to display different text than the heading itself, use the pipe (`|`) character:
     ```
     [[Note Title#Heading|Custom Display Text]]
     ```
   - This will display "Custom Display Text" instead of the actual heading name.

## Linking to Subheadings

- To link to subheadings, simply add additional hash symbols corresponding to the heading level. For example:
  ```
  [[Note Title#Main Heading#Subheading]]
  ```

## Autocomplete Feature

- While typing `[[#`, Obsidian will show a list of available headings in the current note for easy selection. This feature helps streamline the linking process.

## Additional Tips

- **Using Aliases**: You can set up aliases in your notes' frontmatter for easier linking. For example:
  ```markdown
  ---
  aliases: [Alias Name]
  ---
  ```
  Then you can link using `[[Alias Name]]`.

- **Linking to Blocks**: If you need to link to a specific block within a note, use the caret (`^`) symbol followed by a unique identifier:
  ```
  [[Note Title#^block-id]]
  ```

## Troubleshooting

- If links do not navigate correctly (for example, jumping to the bottom of sections), consider switching between edit and preview modes, as some users report inconsistencies in navigation behavior depending on the mode used[3][4].

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage and navigate your notes in Obsidian using headings and subheadings for better organization and accessibility.
